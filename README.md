# DiabetesDietApplication
Introduction
------------
Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are
too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Diabetes of all types can lead
to complications in many parts of the body and can increase the overall risk of
dying prematurely. Possible complications include heart attack, stroke, kidney
failure, leg amputation, vision loss and nerve damage. In pregnancy, poorly
controlled diabetes increases the risk of fetal death and other complications.

Diet plays an important role in managing diabetes. In fact, diet and lifestyle
are important aspects of diabetes management and treatment. One reason is
that the food which is eaten on a day to day basis has a direct impact on the
blood sugar levels. For instance, high carb foods raise blood sugar levels.

People who exercise regularly are better able to control their diabetes, thereby reducing
their risk of diabetes complications.The bodies of people with diabetes require
more fluid when blood glucose levels are high. This can lead to the kidneys
attempting to excrete excess sugar through urine.Drinking water helps to rehydrate
the blood when the body tries to remove excess glucose through urine
